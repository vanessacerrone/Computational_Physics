    "## Numerical solution\n",
    "The main goal of this script is to numerically solve the 2D time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a particle that interacts with a 2D potential barrier. The particle (we assume an electron) is best described as a wave packet, so we have to solve the Schrödinger equation for both its spatial and time dependence. We'll use atomic units, so that $m = 1$ and $\\hbar = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We model the electron initially localized in space at $(x,y) = (x_0,y_0)$ with momentum $\\vec{k}=(k_x.k_y) $ with a wave function that is a gaussian wave packet, defined by: \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity we assume that the gaussian wave packet has the same width both in the x an y directions, but it can be easily modified in order to have $\\sigma_x \\not= \\sigma_y $. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have to numerically solve, using the Crank Nicholson method, the 2D time-dependent Schrödinger's eqaution, which has the following form: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,y,t)}{\\partial t}  = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left( \\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right)  \\psi(x,t) + V(x,y)\\psi(x,y,t) \n",

    "To solve our 2D PDE numerically, we apply both spatial a time discretization: \n",
    "- we consider a 2-dimensiomal spatial grid, with $N_x$ points in the x direction and $N_y$ in the y direction;\n",
    "- each point $(x,y)$ is described by $x=j \\cdot dx$ and $y=i \\cdot dy$ where $i,j = 0,1,...,N-1$ (if $N_x=N_y=N$)\n",
    "- we divide the time domain into $N_t$ equally spaced intervals (time step = dt).\n",

    "Therefore, the wave function $\\psi(x,y,t)$ describing the system at a given spatial point and instant in time will be $ \\psi ^{n}_{i,j}$ where $i$ and $j$ are the spatial indexes and n the temporal one ($n = 0,1,...,N_t-1$).\n",

    "Thus we write the future $n+1$ wave function values on the left-hand side in function of the present $n$ values on the right-hand side, so that it's possible to rewrite the equation in the matrix form. At this point we have equations that are in the form $A \\textbf{x} = \\textbf{b}$, where A is a constant matrix, $\\textbf{x}$ is a column vector that represents the wave function in the next time step and $ \\textbf{b} = M \\textbf{y}$, with M another constant matrix and $\\textbf{y}$  column vector representing the WF in the current time step.
